# Project Name

**Author**: Your Name Goes Here
**Version**: 1.4.3 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
This application is for book lovers everywhere who need a place to search for a store information about books. It alleviates the need for an individual to remember the books that they need to read, or can serve as a repository to remember and reference books the user has already read, among many other possibilities. Books can be stored on select shelves for organization purposes as well.

## Getting Started
- Run NPM install from the root of this directory
- Create a .env file for your local port number and Postgres database info.
- Example env file:
  - PORT=3000
  - DATABASE_URL=postgres://USER:PASSWORD@DOMAIN:PORT/DBNAME

## Architecture
The back end for this app utilizes JavaScript as the programming language, as well as packages such as EJS, for templating and rendering HTML, express (for creating the server), cors (provides the Connect/Express middleware), dotenv (for reading the env file), nodemon (to run a local server), Postgres (for SQL database), superagent (collects data from APIs), and Method Override (unpacking data from forms).

## Change Log
- 05-18-2020 6pm - Application is now live with a fully function express server, containing GET and POST routes for the book resouce and search functionality.

- 05-19-2020 6pm - Application now stores saved books in a database and renders books the user saves to the home page.

- 05-20-2020 8pm - Application now has the ability for users to update and delete their saved books' information.
